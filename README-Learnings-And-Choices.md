# Learnings and Choices recorded as I make them

## Contact Section
Decided to put the contact icons in a permanent sidebar instead of the many nav options included in 
the figma design. My site doesn't need that many categories of 'about me'. A simple blurb will do.
The purpose of the portfolio is to point folks to my projects and then make it easy for them to contact me. Das it!

## Responsive Design
I wanted to plow ahead and build my projects page. The meat of it! 
But, going back and making these pages responsive after styling them for desktop is actually more
work. Especially since Tailwind is mobile first system.

## Passing useState as a Prop in typescript
I found the info on this to be of low-quality/ explained at too high a level.
This could be a blog post.
