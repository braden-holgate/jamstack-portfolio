# Learnings and Choices recorded as I make them

## Contact Section
Decided to put the contact icons in a permanent sidebar instead of the many nav options included in 
the figma design. My site doesn't need that many categories of 'about me'. A simple blurb will do.
The purpose of the portfolio is to point folks to my projects and then make it easy for them to contact me. Das it!
